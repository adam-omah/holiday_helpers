Description of Site Functionality:

This site is intended to assist the user in choosing a Holiday Destination within Europe.

The site will rely heavily on Google Map's/ Google Places API to show the user a rang eof various attractions/ accomodation/activites to do in the selected country.

Upon visiting the site the user is presented with questions to narrow down their search field to what they desire.

this will be achieved by Selector's (either dropdown or radio or check boxes).

Currently the choices being considered are:
1. what type of holiday are you looking for? Surf? Sun? Ski? or Shopping?
2. based on choice 1 the second choice of Country will be reduced (some drop down options may be disabled with respect to the first choice.)
3. The User will then be asked what type of ammenities they are curious about? i.e. Bars/Restaurants/Accomodation/Museums etc.
4. Based on the choices 1&2 above the user will given some suggestions as to which cities will provide the type of holiday they are looking for although they will be free to enter in any city within the selected country. (google autocomplete form)

this list may be updated depending on if more selections would help the user finding the perfect holiday.
